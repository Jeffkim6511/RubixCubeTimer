# Rubix Cube Application

## includes a timer, stores previous times, and more!

This application will be for people that like to **time their rubix cube solves**.
There will be a main page, where you can choose to go to:
- the timer
- previous attempts
- Statistics such as best time, worst time, and a graph that displays your times.
- a scramble formula when you are about to start (scramble means mixing the cube up).
- and more when I think of new ideas.

This application will require:
- a database that stores all the attempts,
- methods that can search through the database and find the best time and worst times
- method that can graph

This can be used by anyone who wants to time their rubix cube solves. 
Additionally, as this timer is pretty basic and not specific for only rubix cubes, it can 
be used for any other competition that requires a timer.

I chose this idea because I have been interested in Rubix cubes
and having an application like this would be beneficial as I can add 
any feature I want that I cannot get in other applications. Therefore,
my app can be fully personalized the way I would like.
